# Understanding Regression: A Streamlit App

This is an interactive Streamlit web application designed to teach the fundamental concepts of supervised machine learning. It provides hands-on, visual demonstrations of linear regression, polynomial regression, and logistic regression.

This app is built for students, data science enthusiasts, and anyone looking for an intuitive way to understand how these core models work.

## Features

The application is organized into three main tabs:

### 1. Manual Linear Fit
* **Goal:** Understand the basics of linear regression (slope, intercept, and error).
* **Interactivity:**
    * Use sliders to manually adjust the **slope (β₁)** and **intercept (β₀)** of a line.
    * See your line plotted against a set of randomly generated data points.
    * Visualize the **residuals** (the errors) as vertical lines.
    * Watch metrics like **SSE** (Sum of Squared Errors), **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error), and **R²** update in real-time.
    * Click a button to compute and display the optimal **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** line to compare with your manual fit.

### 2. Train vs Test (Overfitting)
* **Goal:** Learn why model complexity is a trade-off and what overfitting looks like.
* **Interactivity:**
    * Fit a **polynomial model** to a synthetic dataset (e.g., a sine wave).
    * Adjust the **polynomial degree** (model complexity) with a slider.
    * Observe how the model's fit changes, from underfitting (degree 0 or 1) to a "good" fit, to severe overfitting (high degree).
    * Analyze a separate plot that shows the **Training Error** vs. the **Test Error**.
    * **Key Takeaway:** Watch as the training error continuously drops, but the test error starts to rise after a certain point—this is **overfitting**.

### 3. Logistic Regression
* **Goal:** Introduce binary classification and the concept of a decision boundary.
* **Interactivity:**
    * View a 2D scatter plot of two distinct, overlapping classes.
    * See the **decision boundary** and probability-shaded regions generated by a logistic regression model.
    * Adjust the **regularization parameter (C)** to see how it affects the boundary.
    * Change the **decision threshold** (from 0 to 1) and observe its effect on the **confusion matrix** and metrics.
    * **Key Metrics:** Analyze the **ROC Curve**, **Precision-Recall Curve**, and metrics like **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**.

## How to Run

Follow these steps to run the app on your local machine.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.8+
    * `pip` (Python package installer)

2.  **Clone the Repository (or Download Files):**
    * If this is a git repository:
        ```bash
        git clone <your-repo-url>
        cd <your-repo-directory>
        ```
    * Alternatively, just download the `app.py` and `requirements.txt` files into a new folder.

3.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    # On macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # On Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    * With the virtual environment activated, install the required libraries:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

5.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
    * Ensure your main python file is named (e.g., `app.py`).
    * Run the following command in your terminal:
        ```bash
        streamlit run app.py
        ```

6.  **View the App:**
    * Streamlit will automatically open a new tab in your default web browser. If it doesn't, the terminal will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) that you can open manually.
